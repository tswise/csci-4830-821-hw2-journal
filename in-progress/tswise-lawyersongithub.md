## Project Journal

My biggest technical challenge was finding something I wouldn't break. My second biggest technical challenge was figuring out how to use emacs to create this file and set the word wrap length, which is still alluding me. I am yet to develop  an ease with the basic functions of emacs or any other open source text editor. My biggest nontechnical challenge was finding something that was applicable to my background in law. The most simple solution was to add my name to a registry  of attorneys on github. From there, I needed to reexamine the basics of using github from assignment one. Specifically, the forking, file editing,  pull request process, and the exact sequence in which these steps need to be done. Adding my information to the registry was easy enough - emacs wrangling aside. Most of the three hours spent on this project involved fighting emacs and finding a project that I could add something to - if only my name. This addition will be complete once the pull request is complete. However, as there is a notable backlog on this project, I cannot be sure when that is.
